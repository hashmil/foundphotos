# Project Roadmap: AI-Generated Photo Gallery Website

## Overview

This project aims to create a simple web page resembling an iOS camera roll photo gallery. The gallery will display images generated by the FAL.AI API at specific times throughout the day (6 photos a day). Users can open images and navigate back and forth between them. The website will be built using Node.js and a suitable CSS framework, and it will be hosted on Coolify using Docker.

---

## Phase 1: Planning and Setup

### 1.1 Initialize Git Repository

- Create a new Git repository to track project changes.
- Add a `.gitignore` file to exclude `node_modules`, `.env`, and other unnecessary files.

### 1.2 Environment Setup

- Install Node.js and npm on the development machine.
- Install MongoDB locally or set up a cloud instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).

### 1.3 Create Project Directories

- Create `backend` and `frontend` directories.
- Initialize `package.json` in both directories using `npm init`.

### 1.4 Install Dependencies

#### Backend Dependencies:

- Express
- Mongoose
- dotenv
- node-cron
- `@fal-ai/serverless-client`

#### Frontend Dependencies:

- React
- React DOM
- Axios

### 1.5 Set Up `.env` File

- Create a `.env` file in the project root.
- Add `FAL_KEY` and any other environment variables.

---

## Phase 2: Backend Development

### 2.1 Set Up Express Server

- Create `app.js` in the `backend` directory.
- Initialize an Express.js application.
- Set up basic middleware (e.g., `express.json()`).

### 2.2 Configure MongoDB Connection

- Use Mongoose to connect to MongoDB using the URI from the `.env` file.
- Handle connection events (success, error).

### 2.3 Define Data Models

- Create a `models` directory.
- Define an `Image` model with fields:
  - `url` (String)
  - `width` (Number)
  - `height` (Number)
  - `contentType` (String)
  - `createdAt` (Date)
  - `prompt` (String)
  - `seed` (Number)
  - `hasNSFWContent` (Boolean)

### 2.4 Integrate FAL.AI API

- Import `@fal-ai/serverless-client`.
- Configure the API client with `fal.config()` using the `FAL_KEY` from `.env`.

### 2.5 Implement Image Generation Logic

- Create a service function to generate images using the FAL.AI API.
- Handle progress updates and extract image URL and metadata from the response.
- Save image data to MongoDB.

### 2.6 Schedule Image Generation

- Use `node-cron` to schedule the image generation function at specific times.
- Example: Generate images at 9 AM, 12 PM, 3 PM, 6 PM, 9 PM, and 12 AM.

### 2.7 Create API Endpoints

- In the `routes` directory, create routes for:
  - Fetching all images: `GET /api/images`
  - Fetching a single image by ID: `GET /api/images/:id`

### 2.8 Error Handling and Logging

- Implement error handling middleware.
- Use a logging library (e.g., `morgan`) for request logging.

---

## Phase 3: Frontend Development

### 3.1 Initialize React App

- Use `create-react-app` or set up a custom React application.
- Configure the entry point and scripts in `package.json`.

### 3.2 Set Up CSS Framework

- Choose a CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS).
- Install and configure the framework.

### 3.3 Build the Gallery UI

- Create components:
  - `Gallery`: Displays all images in a grid layout.
  - `ImageCard`: Represents a single image in the gallery.
  - `ImageViewer`: Displays a full-size image with navigation controls.

### 3.4 Implement Navigation Functionality

- Use React Router for client-side routing (if needed).
- Implement next and previous navigation in the `ImageViewer` component.

### 3.5 Fetch Images from Backend

- Use Axios to make API calls to the backend endpoints.
- Fetch all images on the `Gallery` component mount.
- Handle loading states and errors.

### 3.6 Responsive Design

- Ensure the UI is responsive across different devices.
- Test on various screen sizes.

### 3.7 Testing Frontend Components

- Write unit tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library.

---

## Phase 4: Integration

### 4.1 Connect Frontend and Backend

- Update API endpoints in the frontend to point to the backend server.
- Handle CORS issues by enabling CORS middleware in Express or using a proxy in React.

### 4.2 Validate End-to-End Flow

- Verify that images generated by the backend are displayed in the frontend gallery.
- Test image navigation functionality.

### 4.3 Optimize Image Loading

- Implement lazy loading for images in the gallery.
- Use thumbnails if available to reduce initial load time.

### 4.4 Handle Edge Cases

- No images available.
- API errors.
- Navigation at the start or end of the image list.

---

## Phase 5: Deployment

### 5.1 Create Dockerfile

**For Backend**:

- Write a Dockerfile to containerize the Node.js backend.

**For Frontend**:

- Build the React app and serve it using a simple server or via the backend.
- Alternatively, use Nginx to serve the static files.

### 5.2 Create docker-compose.yml

- Define services for the backend, frontend, and MongoDB.

### 5.3 Set Up Coolify on VPS

- Install Coolify on your VPS.
- Configure Coolify to deploy the Dockerized application.
- Add the Git repository to Coolify.

### 5.4 Configure Environment Variables

- In Coolify, set up environment variables for `FAL_KEY` and `MONGODB_URI`.

### 5.5 Domain and SSL Setup

- Configure domain settings if you have a custom domain.
- Set up SSL certificates (Coolify may provide automatic SSL via Let's Encrypt).

---

## Phase 6: Testing and QA

### 6.1 Backend Testing

- Write unit tests for backend functions using Mocha or Jest.
- Test API endpoints using Supertest.

### 6.2 Frontend Testing

- Write unit and integration tests for React components.

### 6.3 End-to-End Testing

- Use a tool like Cypress to perform end-to-end tests.

### 6.4 Performance Testing

- Test the application's performance under load.
- Optimize code as necessary.

### 6.5 Security Testing

- Ensure that API keys and sensitive data are not exposed.
- Test for vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, etc.

---

## Phase 7: Monitoring and Maintenance

### 7.1 Logging and Monitoring

- Implement logging for both backend and frontend.
- Use monitoring tools to track application performance (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).

### 7.2 Backup Strategy

- Set up automated backups for the MongoDB database.

### 7.3 Error Reporting

- Implement error reporting tools (e.g., Sentry) to capture runtime errors.

### 7.4 Scheduled Maintenance

- Plan for regular maintenance windows for updates and upgrades.

---

## Timeline

- **Week 1**:
  - Phase 1 and Phase 2
- **Week 2**:
  - Phase 3 and Phase 4
- **Week 3**:
  - Phase 5
- **Week 4**:
  - Phase 6 and Phase 7

*Adjust the timeline based on actual progress and any unforeseen challenges.*

## Additional Considerations

### Image Prompts and Variations

- Decide on the prompts to be used for image generation.
- Consider creating a list of prompts to cycle through or randomize.

### Handling NSFW Content

- Utilize the `enable_safety_checker` option in the FAL.AI API.
- Decide on how to handle images flagged with NSFW content.

### Scalability

- Design the application with scalability in mind.
- Use a load balancer if expecting high traffic.

### Future Enhancements

- **User Accounts**: Allow users to log in and save favorite images.
- **Comments and Likes**: Enable social features for user engagement.
- **Image Download**: Allow users to download images.
- **Push Notifications**: Notify users when new images are added.

### Documentation

- Maintain clear documentation for the codebase.
- Update the README.md with setup instructions.

By following this roadmap, we will create a fully functional, AI-generated photo gallery website that meets the project requirements and is ready for deployment and scaling. Regular reviews and adjustments should be made throughout the project to accommodate any changes or new insights.
